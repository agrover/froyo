Froyo

Semi-automated bulk storage management

You give Froyo block devices (hard drives) and it gives you a single
redundant filesystem. You may add any size drive to expand it. When a
drive goes bad, your data is automatically reshaped in the background
across the remaining drives (if space allows). You can replace older,
smaller drives with bigger new ones while the filesystem remains online.

Drobo + Free + You = Froyo!
